# DappCamp Warriors

In this last section we are adding the frontend for our Dapp. The frontend is at the [frontend](frontend) folder.

## Step 5: Add stake and unstake buttons

- In this step, we add "stake and "unstake" buttons to the NFT component. The logged-in users will be able to see these buttons next to the NFTs they own.
- The stake and unstake buttons make calls to the Staking contract
