# DappCamp Warriors

This repo contains a step by step walkthrough towards a fully fledged dApp that combines an NFT collection, an ERC20 token, and DeFi.
Huge shoutout to [Lucas Janon](https://github.com/lucas-janon), a DappCamp alumni from Cohort 2 for his help with his repo. 
This repo is derived from his original repo [here](https://github.com/dappcamp/dappcamp-warriors)

## Repo structure

If you take a look at the existing branches, you'll see that there are multiple numbered branches. They build on top of each other, starting from `0-overview` (the one you're in, right now).

Each branch has its own readme, like this one, with an overview of the progress made towards the final dApp.

Also, if you go to the [pull requests](https://github.com/dappcamp-cohort-4/dappcamp-warriors/pulls), every branch has a PR
to the previous one, which is useful to see the [diff](https://github.com/dappcamp-cohort-4/dappcamp-warriors/pull/2/files).
